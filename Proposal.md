# Final Project proposal
# (Identification of Sailfin catfishes in Sri Lanka based on Mitochondrial DNA data and morphological data)

## Introduction
Sailfin catfishes are a group of loricariid fish that are native to South America they have been introduced to tropical and subtropical countries via the aquarium trade and because of occasional escaped of them have resulted in the establishment of their populations outside of their native range. In 2017 I started this project as my undergraduate thesis project. I finished that in 2019 and also published it as a research paper. In that project, I made a phylogeneticÂ tree using MEGA and Mr. Bayes software and also did a principal component analysis on their morphology using SPSS software. 

I haven't previous experience in making phylogenetic trees and PCA using Python, So for this project, I am planning to make a new phylogenetics tree and PCA using my existing mitochondrial DNA data set and morphological data set.

## Methods
1. For the phylogenetics tree, I am planning to use Thirty 16s mitochondrial DNA sequence from Sri Lanka and 17 GenBank sequences from other countries. I hope to work on this [BioPhython](https://biopython.org/wiki/Phylo) tutorial to learn how to create phylogenomics trees from Python.
2. For the PCA, I am planning to use morphological data set that include data on 29 sailfincatfishes that collected from Sri Lanka. And still I am searching a good tutorial about how to create a PCA using Python.
